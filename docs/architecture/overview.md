## Design Principles

- **Deterministic output**: Prompt composition iterates traits in fixed `TraitKind::ALL` order via `[TraitLevel; 15]` array
- **Cosine similarity**: Compatibility scoring measures behavioral pattern direction, not magnitude
- **`#[must_use]`**: Pure functions annotated to prevent accidental value drops
- **Zero network I/O in core**: All core modules are pure computation; network deps are behind the `ai` feature flag
- **Clamped values**: Mood dimensions are always clamped to [-1.0, 1.0]; decay factors to [0.0, 1.0]
- **Minimal allocations**: Prompt builders use `write!`/`writeln!` directly into Strings; static slices where possible
- **Serde everywhere**: All public types are serializable for persistence and network transport
- **Non-exhaustive enums**: `BhavaError`, `TraitKind`, `Emotion`, `IdentityLayer` are `#[non_exhaustive]` for forward compatibility

## Data Flow

### Personality → Prompt

```
TraitKind × TraitLevel → trait_behavior() → behavioral instruction text
PersonalityProfile.compose_prompt() → iterates ALL traits in order → "## Personality\n- instruction\n..."
```

### Emotion Lifecycle

```
EmotionalState::new() → neutral baseline
  → stimulate(Emotion, intensity) → nudge mood vector (clamped)
  → apply_decay(now) → exponential decay toward baseline over time
  → deviation() → distance from baseline (Euclidean)
```

### Identity Composition

```
compose_preamble() → cosmological "In Our Image" text + 5 layer descriptions
compose_identity_prompt(IdentityContent) → preamble + populated layer sections (### Soul, ### Spirit, ...)
```

### Sentiment Analysis

```
text → lowercase → single-pass whitespace iteration
  → check negation (not, never, hardly...) → flip next word
  → check intensity modifier (very, extremely, slightly...) → scale next word
  → match against 5 lexicons (positive, negative, trust, curiosity, frustration)
  → compute valence (pos_score - neg_score) / word_count, clamped [-1.0, 1.0]
  → SentimentResult { valence, confidence, emotions, matched_keywords }
```

### Trait-to-Mood Baseline

```
PersonalityProfile (15 traits)
  → per-trait valence/arousal modifiers (TRAIT_VALUE_MODIFIERS table)
  → average across all traits
  → apply compound effects (7 emergent combos: playful, nurturing, mentoring, ...)
  → MoodVector { joy: valence, arousal: arousal }
```

### AI Integration (full pipeline)

```
compose_system_prompt(profile, identity, mood, spirit)
  → compose_identity_prompt()     — archetype preamble + layer content
  → profile.compose_prompt()      — trait behavioral instructions
  → compose_mood_prompt()         — current mood state + tone guide
  → spirit text                   — passions, inspirations, pains
  → single String for InferenceRequest.system

Response → apply_sentiment_feedback(text, state, scale)
  → sentiment::analyze()          — valence + emotions
  → stimulate emotional state     — scaled feedback into mood vector
```

### Live Sentiment Monitoring

```
SentimentMonitor::new(scale)
  → feed(chunk)                     — buffer text, analyze at sentence boundaries
  → feed_and_apply(chunk, state)    — feed + apply results to EmotionalState
  → flush()                         — analyze remaining buffered text
  → summary()                       — positive/negative/neutral counts + average valence
```

### Persistence

```
BhavaStore (trait)
  ├── save_profile / load_profile / delete_profile / list_profile_ids
  ├── save_emotional_state / load_emotional_state
  ├── save_mood_history / load_mood_history
  ├── append_snapshot / load_snapshots
  ├── save_relationships / load_relationships
  └── save_spirit / load_spirit
